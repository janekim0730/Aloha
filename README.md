Experience
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>This was my first website built. I enjoyed learning different tags, flexbox, css tricks and many more. It was fascinating to see how 
the codes display on a screen. It was difficult to grasp the concept of flexbox at first, but playing around with the codes and 
understanding the idea of how it works were interesting. </p>
